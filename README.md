# Snek3D

Hello! We are Amir Safavi, Colton Klable and Daniel Migdale. Thanks for looking at our project!

Setup:
1) Download Unity hub and install dependencies
2) Download Unity Editor v. 2021.3.13f1
3) Pull from git and open project in editor, build, and play!

If there is an issue with the main menu not loading the game when play is pressed, go to file> build settings> 
add the main menu first and then the file called samplescene to the build order.
